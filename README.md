# ZeusVSHumans
An end-of-study project which is a 3D mobile game in a team of 4.
The idea is to make a mobile game where the player embodies the god of thunder, Zeus.
The objective is to survive as long as possible against humanity controlled by an AI which, at a certain stage of evolution, will be able to kill Zeus, the player.
